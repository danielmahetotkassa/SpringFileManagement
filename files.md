# Microservices With Spring Cloud
- Introduction to Microservies architectural Style
- hands on Experience with the spring cloud components 
- Articulate the Microservices Architectural Style
    - Advantage and Disadvantage
- Build Simple Spring boot Applications
    - Web Interfaces, RESTful interfaces, spring Data, spring Data REST
- Build Microservices applications using spring cloud
    - Utilize centralized configuration using spring cloud config and Spring Cloud Bus- Push Notification- Whenever it get the update - the system automatically updates the connected systems. 
    - Utilize Service Discovery using Eureka 
    - Implement resilient Service clients with Ribbon, Feign, and Hystrix
- What are micro services 
    - decomposition of single system into a suite of small services, each running as independent processes and intercommunicating via open protocol
    - developing a single application as a suite of small each running in its own process and communicating withe lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP resource API. 
    - Fine-grained SOA
    - composing a single application using a suite of small services( rather than a single, monolithic applications
    - each running as independent processes ( not merely modules / components within single executable 
    - intercommunicating via open protocols (like HTTP/REST, or messaging ) - REdis is one of the messaging services that most companies are using- 
    - Messaging Serivies is one that accepts a message stores in a queue and sends the message to the connected devices. 
    - separately written, deployed, scaled and maintained ( potentially in different languages)
    -  Services encapsulate business capabilities ( rather than language constructs ( classes, packages ) as primary way to encapsulate
    - services are independent replaceable and upgradable
- Microserives are not
    - The same SOA
    - SOA is about integrating various enterprise applications. Microservies are mainly about decomposing a single applications 
    - A silver bullet 
        - The micro services architecture involves drawbacks and risks 
    - Twitter moved from RUB:Y monolith to microservies
    - Facebook move form PHP to microsevices
    - Netflix mover JAva mon
    - this is the first commit in the application
